<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an enthusiastic and curious Software Engineer with an addiction to the feeling you get when you finally solve a problem you've been stuck on for a while!</p>

<p>My background is in engineering but not software engineering. Being a curious individual, through my life I have had many interests in what I wanted to pursue as a career, at university I studied Mechanical Engineering and graduated with a first class degree in Master of Mechanical Engineering. Throughout this journey of self discovery, coding has always been in the back of my mind but I never got around to actually delving into it.</p>

<p>After graduating, with a bit of free time on my hands, I learned a bit of coding on my own and came to the realisation that THIS IS IT! This is what I wanted to do!</p>

<p>Not wanting to waste anymore time in delaying my interest in code, I signed up to a full time bootcamp that taught me many skills and strengthened my resolve in wanting to become a Software Engineer. After graduating from the bootcamp I interviewed with a company who were partnered with the bootcamp... AND GOT THE JOB! I finally had gotten my foot in the door!</p>

<p>At the start of my employment at my first company I did a bootcamp part 2, this was a secondary bootcamp that was in continuation of the one I did previously. I gave it my all and put my best work forward and ended up winning a prize for the best project at the end of this bootcamp as the lead engineers and managers were very impressed with my work! This was one of the most rewarding feelings as throughout this journey I had an impending sense of imposter syndrome, but I overcame it every step of the way.</p>
